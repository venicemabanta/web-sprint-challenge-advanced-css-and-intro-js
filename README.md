# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

Accessibility refers to either websites that are designed so that people with disabilities would be able to navigate through the webiste, and for people who are using different devices to view the website, e.g. an a tablet or a phone.
For people with disabilities, elements in the webpage should be properly tagged, like images have to have a description in their properties. Choosing color for the text and the background are also important for those who are color blind.
When using mobile devices to view a webpage, the resolution of their browser is different from a desktop browser. If the webpage is not optimized for mobile users, it may look cluttered and way too small/large depending on how the webpage was styled by default (desktop). 

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 

For this question, I'm just going to cover the aspects of accessibility using mobile devices. Testing the webpage using google chrome is one of them, by using ctrl + shift + m. Here you can choose which resolution you want to test your website on. Viewing it on your phone can be also helpful, just so you can see if the text you're using is not too large/too small. On both google chrome and your mobile device, one thing to make sure of is checking if the webpage has a horizontal scrollbar. Having a horizontal scrollbar on your webpage just makes it a little more difficult for visitors to view the entire content of the webpage.

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

Variables are basically data that can be used for coding. This can range from names, usernames, to comments and lists.

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

Javascript functions is a block of code than can be executed multiple times. Using functions will help the user calculate, pull data, compile data and a lot more. The purpose of using a function instead of a regular block of code is you can access a block code with a single line of code without repeating.

5. How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?

It depends on the type of object that I'm trying to access. Dot notations (array.object), and bracket notations (array['object']). The difference between the two is the bracket notation needs to specify a number or a string, rather than the object itself.

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
![alt text](assets/tests_debug_terminal_final.png "your terminal should look like this")

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [ ] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
